# UI Testing Tool

This project demonstrates an experimental UI testing workflow powered by
[OpenAI](https://openai.com/) and [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/).

## Features

- **Natural language tests** – send a description and target URL and let
  OpenAI create a Playwright script.
- **Automated execution** – the generated test is executed with
  Playwright. A DOM snapshot and screenshot are captured.
- **AI validation** – the DOM and screenshot are sent back to OpenAI for
  pass/fail evaluation.

## Setup

1. Install Node.js (v18+).
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your OpenAI API key.

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. In another terminal run the client CLI:

   ```bash
   node client/index.js
   ```

The client will prompt for a target URL and a natural language
description. It will then display the status and result of the test.

## Environment Variables

The server expects the following variables (see `.env.example`):

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` – OpenAI API key used for generating and validating
  tests.

## Warning

This is a proof‑of‑concept implementation. Running untrusted code
generated by a model may be unsafe. Use with caution.
